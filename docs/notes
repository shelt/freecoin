## CURRENT TODO ##
Determining block validity with respect to chains
Prune network.c and ensure that:
- startup() which checks to see if block db is nonexistant. If it is, create it and add the initial block (which is hardcoded).
- all data assembly is done in build.c in the most DRY way possible
move all existing function descriptions to header files.
add nonexistant definitions to header files.


## DEFINITIONS ##
get    : retrieve
set    : write
compute: compute and retrieve
update : compute and write

## PREFIXES ##
r_      : this function deals with raw memory allocation. often encapsulated by m_ functions.
m_      : this function allocates memory that is returned in some way, or deallocates memory that was previously allocated by a sister m_ function.
M_      : this struct is an encapsulation of allocated data with info about it (size).
v_      : verbose function
data_   : modifies data buffers or databases. Likely accepts dbs parameter.
tx_     : modifies a transaction in some way.
block_  : modifies a block in some way.
msg_    : accepts raw parameters and sends a message
msgall_ : accepts raw parameters and calls the equivilent msg_ for all peers

# Constants
POS_      : refers to the position within a block (POS_BLOCK_*) or tx (POS_TX_*) or other fixed size object (such as a message)
SIZE_     : refers to the size of some part of a fixed size object (such as a block, tx or message)
MAX_      : refers to the max of some object


having more than 255 txs could create a bug where transactions stored at indexes abobve that are not sent


#### NOTES FOR REDO ####
ALL REDONE FILES ARE CANON UNLESS CHANGED
NEVER use block_get_x and tx_get_x. USE bytes_to_uint(someblock[BLOCK_POS_X])
INSTEAD of doing block_add_tx, we do 

#### NOTES FOR STANDARDS ####
ALWAYS refer to a destination memory area as: dest
ALWAYS newline parameter lists of 4 or more (see transactions.c for bracket style)


### TODO ###
all instances of cursor should probably use the for loop index instead
transactions.c is_coinbase_tx
bignum.c
blocks.c etarget target
validation.c
    // Verify the validity of a given block and all subsequent blocks up to an end block
    is valid chain

    // Verify the validity of a given block (but not it's previous block)
    is valid block
    is_valid_blockhash


#### INFO ####
// passing a point in an array as a ptr looks like &array[x]
// understand importance of stack vars and pass by value; no memory leaks occur
